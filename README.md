Starbucks Capstone Project solution for ML Engineer Nanodegree

The files provided in this repository are my solution to the the Starbucks Capstone Project for Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree on Udacity. The description of the whole project can be found in **capstone_project_starbucks.pdf** file.

The problem to be solved is to find the optimal model, which will help to get the highest conversion of the clients, i.e. maximize the number of people making the orders among those who saw the each type of offer in the application. 

The steps to achieve this goal are the following:
1) **Data Processing:** exploration, preprocessing and transformation of the raw data, creation of new features. The solution can be found in "data_processing.ipynb" file.
2) **Modeling:** creation of the algorithms for the customers' conversion maximization for each type of reward-offer. The solution can be found in "modeling.ipynb" file.
